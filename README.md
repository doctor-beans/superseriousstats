superseriousstats
=================

A small and efficient program written in PHP for creating a Web page with statistics out of various types of IRC logs. The program keeps track of its parse history and only processes new activity before storing any accumulated data in a MySQL database.

Suitable for high volume IRC channels and large log archives. Once you have superseriousstats running it is relatively easy to set up your own IRC services (e.g. bots) to interact with the database and provide last seen information and many other statistics directly in your channel.

If you want superseriousstats to also support the logfile format you use, you can create your own parser file. Alternatively you can convince me to make one for you where you take on the task of testing the results. It helps if you can provide an overview of the (default) logging syntax used by the client.
