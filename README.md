superseriousstats
=================

A small and efficient program written in PHP for creating a Web page with statistics out of various types of IRC logs. The program keeps track of its parse history and only processes new activity before storing any accumulated data in a MySQL database.

Suitable for high volume IRC channels and large log archives. Once you have superseriousstats running it is relatively easy to set up your own IRC services (e.g. bots) to interact with the database and provide last seen information and many other statistics directly in your channel.
